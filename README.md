# Future value prediction of stock price using python
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a Python based project which is used to predict the stock price from the finance website (YAHOO FINANCE). I am extracting the historical data from the website using "beautifulsoup" then we are using LSTM which is a model in tensorflow to predict the future value of the data and compare the prediction with the present value by plotting the predicted value and the present value. Then I also measure the accuracy of the prediction.

# requirement
Python 3.7,
Tensorflow 2.1,
Matplotlib,
CSV,
Panda, 
Numpy

I'm using Anaconda (Spyder) to implement this project

# Stable internet connection is required to run this project.

FINANCE.PY = is only able to predict the google stock price.
TESTING.PY = is a kind of dinamic in nature. Every thing is user input, perhaps the only drawback is that it can only able to predict from              the website (YAHOO.COM).
